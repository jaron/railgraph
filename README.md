RAILGRAPH
---------

This code allows you to harvest transport information from Wikipedia and use it to construct a node-edge graph, 
where the nodes are stations and edges are connections between them. 

Also included are some scripts written in R that will allow you to perform some useful social network analyses 
on a node-edge graph stored in GraphML format.


*Dependencies*

To create a graph from Wikipedia you'll need the following:

* Java (and Maven)
* Neo4j
